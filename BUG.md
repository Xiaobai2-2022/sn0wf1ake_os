# Bugs exists in this project

## Frontend

1. The display needs to be remake so that it supports proper wrapping of text, as well as the empty enter function.

2. When enter is pressed and the div for input-line has shrinked from two to one causing an incorrect spacing.

3. Pressing enter at nothing behaves incorrectly (does nothing).
